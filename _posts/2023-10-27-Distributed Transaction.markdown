## Distributed Transactions

> The first option could be to just not split the data apart in the first place.

Aggregate the infos about Distributed Transactions across multiple references.

### Two Phase Commit (2PC)
#### Propose(Prepare) phase, Commit/Abort phase
- A leader (or coordinator) that holds the state, collects votes
- Prepare : If a cohort decides that it can commit, it notifies the coordinator about the positive vote.
- Commit/abort : If even one of the cohorts votes to abort the transaction, the coordinator sends the Abort message to all of them.

#### Cohort Failures in 2PC

#### Coordinator Failures in 2PC

One of the cohorts does not receive a commit or abort command from the coordinator during the second phase
![2PC_lf.png](https://hongjhih77.github.io/img/2023-10-27-Distributed%20Transaction/2PC_lf.png)

The coordinator fails after collecting the votes, but before broadcasting vote results, the cohorts end up in a state of uncertainty.

#### Cons
- Latency: The more participants you have, and the more latency you have in the system.
- Transaction Coordinator: The Transaction Coordinator becomes a single point of failure at times. The Transaction Coordinator may go down before sending a commit message to all the participants. In such cases, all the transactions running on the participants will go in a blocked state. They would commit only once the coordinator comes up & sends a commit signal.
- Distributed locks [1]:
    - The workers/cohorts need to lock local resources to ensure that the commit can take place during the second phase.
    - The challenges of coordinating locks among multiple participants.

#### Example
Business Scenario example using [DTM](https://en.dtm.pub/practice/msg.html#success-process) as a TM (Transaction Manager)

Transfer $30 from A to B across banks.

If A fails to deduct due to insufficient balance, then the transfer will directly fail and return an error; 
if the deduction is successful, then the next transfer operation TransIn will be carried out, because TransIn does not have the problem of insufficient balance, 
and it can be assumed that the transfer operation will definitely succeed.

### SAGA
- Coordinate multiple changes in state.
- Avoids the need for locking resources.
- Break down these LLTs(long lived transactions) into a sequence of transactions, each of which can be handled independently.
- Have atomicity for each individual transaction inside the overall saga

#### Saga Failure Modes

- **Backward recovery**: A **compensating actions** that allow us to undo previously committed transactions.
- **Forward recovery**: pick up from the point where the failure occurred, **retry** transactions.
- A saga allows us to recover from business failures, not technical failures.
- The saga assumes the underlying components are working properlyâ€”that the underlying system is reliable, and that we are then coordinating the work of reliable components.

##### Saga rollbacks

Reordering workflow steps to reduce rollbacks

#### Implementing Sagas

##### Orchestrated sagas
- A central coordinator.
- A command-and-control approach: the orchestrator controls what happens and when
- A good degree of visibility

![Saga_orch.png](https://hongjhih77.github.io/img/2023-10-27-Distributed%20Transaction/Saga_orch.png)

Cons:
- Domain coupling.
- Logic that should otherwise be pushed into the services can start to become absorbed in the orchestrator instead.

##### Choreographed sagas
- Trust-but-verify architecture.
- Heavy use of events: events are broadcast in the system, and interested parties are able to receive them.
- Use some sort of message broker to manage the reliable broadcast.
- Less coupled.

![Saga_chor.png](https://hongjhih77.github.io/img/2023-10-27-Distributed%20Transaction/Saga_chor.png)

Cons:
- Harder to work out what is going on.
- Lack a way of knowing what state a saga

Fix cons.:
- A **correlation ID**, we can put it into all of the events that are emitted as part of this saga.
- Have a service whose job it is to just vacuum up all these events and present a view.
